                        book, felt like she brought us along so happily to just leave us hanging off the cliff at the
                        end. I guess that is to be expected in the second book of a trilogy. The writing is just as good
                        as the first, makes the story a fast read.

                        frustrated and wanted to scream to not put us through this torture at the
                        end.<br><br>user0002:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really enjoyed this book, felt like she brought us
